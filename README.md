# Inventory-System
Inventory System using a MongoDB database.

## Project Flow
An application is built which will store the data in MongoDB database which is stored on a cloud system and perform CRUD operations using RESTful API and Flask. Apart, from using REST API's, we have created user-defined API's as well. Testing these user-defined API’s is performed on Postman. This application stores and manages the quantity of different item present in inventory. Also, admin and staff have different privileges to access the data. We have included “About us” form which describes about the café shop and also, we have a provision for the customer to add review about the café shop. This project could help for:
->Sales analysis,
->Stacking up items in a warehouse or a shop in our case,
->Measure popularity,
->Identify top trends.
->Sentimental Analysis.
